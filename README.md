Stock Price Prediction
A machine learning web application that predicts stock prices using historical data. The project incorporates a trained Keras model for forecasting future stock prices and is built with a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Overview
This project uses:

Streamlit to create an interactive web application.

Keras to load a pre-trained model (Latest_stock_price_model.keras) for making predictions.

yfinance to download historical stock data.

Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing and performance metrics.

The application allows users to input a stock ticker symbol (default is "GOOG"), fetches the corresponding historical data, and displays both the raw stock data and predictions from the model.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock_price_prediction.git
cd stock_price_prediction/stock_price_precidiction
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Packages:

Install the dependencies using pip. A sample requirements.txt may include:


pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install yfinance
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow  # or keras if using standalone keras
If you have a requirements.txt file, install with:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Web Application:

Launch the app using Streamlit:


streamlit run web_stock_price_prictor.py
This should open a new browser window displaying the Stock Price Predictor App. Enter a stock ticker in the text input box and view the downloaded stock data along with predictions.

Jupyter Notebook:

If you prefer exploring the code interactively, you can open the rakeshstock_price1 .ipynb notebook:


jupyter notebook rakeshstock_price1 .ipynb
The notebook may provide additional context or experimental analysis for the stock prediction logic.

Model Details
Model File: Latest_stock_price_model.keras

Framework: Keras (integrated with TensorFlow backend)

Training Data: The model was trained using historical stock data from the past 20 years as fetched via yfinance.

Usage: The model is loaded in the Streamlit app and used for predicting future stock prices based on user input.
